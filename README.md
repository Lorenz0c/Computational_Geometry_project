# Computational_Geometry_project

This project has been developed as exam for the Computational Geometry course of Università degli studi di Milano (accademic year 2020-2021).

The main purpose of the project was to use Bèzier curves to realize realistic movements of chess pieces on a chess board.
The movements changes in relation to the type of piece to move and on the position of other pieces on its trajectory.
Each visual element present in the project (pieces and board) has been realized with FreeCAD while, for the remaning of the project has been developed on Unity.
The programming language used in the script files is C#. 

The final result is an WebGL application which allows the user to move alternatively the pieces of the two colors on the chess board to simulate any possibole move of a chess game.

There is also a menu which allows to select between different camera angles and different roules that can be activated/deactivated, and to restart the chess match.
